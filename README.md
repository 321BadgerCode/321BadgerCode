## Intro

> I'm a self-taught programmer who started programming in 6th grade to make games in Unity using C#. I've since moved on to take AP computer science classes. This [Homework repo](https://github.com/321BadgerCode/hw/tree/main) displays some of the programs I've made in my classes. This [ASCII Odyssey Repo](https://github.com/321BadgerCode/ascii_odyssey/tree/main) was my CPT submission for APCSP, which I got a **5** on the final for.

### C++ Poem
```
In the realm of pointers, where memory dances,
C++ unfolds, a symphony of chances.
Semicolons like whispers, brace the blocks,
Where algorithms sing, and logic unlocks.

With #include commands, we summon our might,
Libraries gather, lending their light.
Classes and structs, the blueprints we hold,
From which objects rise, stories untold.

Loops iterate, weaving a thread so fine,
Conditions branching, where destinies twine.
Functions march forth, bearing their load,
Returning their values, down logic's road.

But syntax can trip, and errors descend,
Compilers cry out, where logic must mend.
Debug lines shimmer, a beacon in night,
Guiding us onward, to code's shining light.

From simple hello to worlds built anew,
C++ empowers, dreams into view.
With patience and passion, each line we craft,
A digital poem, a world, a draft.

So let the code flow, let the logic reign,
In the language of C++, where beauty and pain
Intertwine, a dance of the mind,
Where imagination and reason we find.
```
